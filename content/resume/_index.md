As Vice President of Engineering at Vestiaire Collective, I steer the Seller Experience Collective, a diverse, global team. Our Collective comprises three squads focused on distinct seller segments within our international luxury fashion marketplace, providing tailored experiences to enhance engagement, user experience and efficiency.

My remit extends to key aspects of the selling process, catering to a wide array of business types. I oversee critical features like item deposition, commission structures, buyer-seller negotiation, chat functionality, price drops, and product taxonomy, providing tailored solutions for each business type including Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C), Business-to-Consumer (B2C), Consignment, and Brand partners. With my team, we delivered numerous breakthroughs across the seller scope, including a complete transformation of Vestiaire Collective monetisation strategy.

A landmark achievement has been our 'Resale As A Service' platform, a PAAS solution that empowers luxury brands to offer second-hand service, bolstering industry sustainability.

Additionally, I play a significant role in shaping our product roadmap, ensuring our technological advancements align with market needs.

In the first six months of my tenure, I was also the Interim VP Engineering of the Conversion Collective based in Paris (~30 Engineers across 4 squads). I notably led the design and architecture of an in-house Rule Engine that provides flexibility and performance for defining and executing business rules and is now used across the entire organisation (shipping, fees, customisation, etc.).
