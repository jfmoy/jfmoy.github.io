## About

I believe in Software Craftmanship; I am passionate about Software. I design and implement well structured, robust, and maintainable software.

I value agility, adaptability and proactivity: to new requirements, to new needs, to new technologies, to new environments.

I learn from others: from my team, from my peers, from the community.

I believe in sharing my knowledge and promoting these values through technical leadership.
