# Who am I?

My name is Jean-Fran√ßois "Jeff" Moy. I am a French Chief Technical Officer living in London, United Kingdom.

I believe Software to be a craft. I design and implement well structured, robust, and maintainable software. I value agility, adaptability and proactivity: to new requirements, to new needs, to new technologies, and to new environments. I learn from others: from my team, from my peers, and from the community. I believe in sharing my knowledge and promoting these values through technical leadership.

I am passionate about Mobile and Operating Systems. In my career, I have implemented a protocol stack for Visual Voicemail in Android, built a playful and complete in-browser chat experience, improved the web runtime and environment of the Ubuntu distribution, and finally help build the most powerful and complete IOT platform with Ksubaka, driving thousands of screens remotely.
